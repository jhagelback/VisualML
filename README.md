# VisualML
Visual ML is a small machine learning library with a GUI to visualize the decision boundaries for a classifier and how they change when the classifier is trained. This is useful in teaching machine learning where students can see how different types of classifiers learns. The library can also be used for traditional machine learning tasks such as training and testing on a dataset and evaluate accuracy.

The following classifiers are available in the library:
- k-Nearest Neighbor
- Softmax Linear classifier
- Neural Network
- Deep Neural Network (2 or more hidden layers)
